- Tests for idea
- Tests for higher order functions
- Lazy:
    * The user should implement a data strucutre ( lazy heap? ) using lazy vals
    * The user should change params ( more than one) to be lazily evaluated to minimize performance overhead
    * The user should implement a collection pager using lazy Scala collection

- Tests for lazy module

- Implementation for all modules!
