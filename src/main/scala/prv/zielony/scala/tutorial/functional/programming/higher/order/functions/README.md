    A. Use the "defaultEntityManager" value in the "dao" package to configure the "findPersonDef", "findAccountDef" and
    "saveDef" private methods to obtain the "save" "findPersonById" and "findAccountById" values

    "indAccountBalanceForPerson" function

    C. Define the "findPerson" method, just for fun
